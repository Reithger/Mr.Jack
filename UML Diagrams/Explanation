So I had a look at this after promising some folks the UML for this project and realized how bad of a job we'd done, so I have provided the
original UML with the program untouched, then a UML after I'd shuffled the Classes around and made some new packages/hierarchy, and then a third
UML after I did some small refactoring to reduce some associations, while others were too substantial to fix in my current time frame.

v1, v2, and v3 are the respective UML Diagrams of each step.

These should be taken as inspiration in some ways, and as mistakes to avoid in others, this is a messy one! The game was also very complex, to be
fair to my past self, but oof. I would do things very differently now.

Enjoy!
